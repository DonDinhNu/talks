## Realworld
1. Hard to work together.
  * We usually begin at early of the day, around 8:30AM. Warm up with some harrassment questions and go fucking to terminal...
  * Start in same time keeps us more focus, less time to explain or wait for others. AND.......can built new habit to start immediately.
  * Force our into a pair. No need to catchup.
2. One codes, another sleeps.
  * Long invents the hand toy game.[image]
  * Keep fresh mind to focus on the task.
  * Have to take the keyboard because noone can do "handjob" for a while.
  * Big hands are comming.
3. Lost in the monitor.
  * One codes, another can not understand.
  * Out level.
